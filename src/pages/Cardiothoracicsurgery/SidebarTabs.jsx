          A branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart and blood
          vessels. The work of our cardiologists for adults includes diagnosis
          and treatment of adult congenital heart disease, heart failure,
          coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease and arrhythmias.
          All the necessary investigations like ECG, Echocardiogram, Treadmill
          test, Holter monitoring, Ambulatory BP monitoring, tilt table testing,
          cardiac CT, cardiac MRI, and nuclear heart scanning are available to
          provide you with the best adult cardiology treatment at our
          multispeciality hospital in Erode.

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECG:</h2>
        <p>
          Cardiac problems such as heart attack, heart block, etc. can be
          detected by measuring the electrical activity of the heart, which is
          done by electrocardiogram (ECG).
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECHOCARDIOGRAM:</h2>
        <p>
          The structure and function of the heart can be assessed by moving
          images produced by sound waves. Various heart diseases can be
          diagnosed by this readily available investigation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">TREADMILL TEST:</h2>
        <p>
          Patients walk on a treadmill at graded levels and their 12-lead ECG
          will be monitored for heart rate and ST-T segment changes. These
          findings help detect coronary artery disease, heart block, and more.
        </p>

          STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
        </h2>
        <p>
          The heart is exerted by exercise or medicines and its activity is
          monitored by echocardiography. For those unable to perform a treadmill
          test, this is a very useful alternative to rule out coronary artery
          disease.
