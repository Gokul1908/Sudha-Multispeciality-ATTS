        </p>

        <p>
          We also offer advanced structural heart disease interventions, including Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), along with other catheter-based procedures such as Balloon Mitral Valvotomy (BMV), Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR), Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR), renal artery stenting, and subclavian artery stenting.

          <p>
            TEVAR is a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure in which a metal stent is placed across a weakened section (aneurysm) of the thoracic aorta. As it avoids open surgery, patients typically recover faster and are discharged within three to four days.
